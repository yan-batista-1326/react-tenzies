## How to play
Everyone gets ten dice. When signalled to start, you roll all your dice untill you get the same number on every one of them and shouts "TENZI!".

You can hold dice and roll the rest to get the same number of the dice you are holding.

Your objective in the game is to be fast and shout "Tenzi" first than everyone else, but since this game is offline, you should aim to get a fast time.
